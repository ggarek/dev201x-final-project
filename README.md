#World Artist and Paintings

This is the final project for the edx.ord course named ["Microsoft: DEV201x Introduction to TypeScript"](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV201x+2015_T2).

It is written using React and Typescript. And it uses [DBPedia](http://dbpedia.org/) as endpoint.

The site allows you to select a painter and explore his artworks.

It is published via github pages and is available [here](http://ggarek.github.io/dev201x-final-project/)
